Project Skeleton for PHP
========================

### Description

A PHP project skeleton to build other PHP projects from.

Templating a PHP repo allows me to keep processes, protocols, and have a place to
quickly replicate an environment to test or develop PHP in.

Development

The necessity of reliable documentation is both important to the developer responsible for

building, revitalizing, and sharing the knowledge from discovery to release.
